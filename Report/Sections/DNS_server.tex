\section{DNS Server}
For the simulation of the DDoS attack, a dedicated DNS server was established on a virtual machine running the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system.
The virtual machine was allocated 2GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores to ensure sufficient resources for handling the simulated traffic.\\
To create the DNS server, the open-source software BIND9 was employed. This widely adopted DNS server software offers robust functionality and configurability.
The server was specifically configured to act as the authoritative server for the domain name "ediproject.com."
By assuming authority over this domain, the DNS server can respond to DNS queries and provide legitimate DNS responses during the simulation.\\
To mimic the characteristics of a genuine DNS server, a total of seven NS records and five MX-type records were meticulously added to the DNS server's configuration.
The inclusion of these records introduces diverse amplification factors, enabling the analysis of the DDoS attack's effectiveness based on these factors.
By incorporating varying NS and MX records, the simulation can reflect the behavior of a real DNS server and offer insights into the impact of
different amplification configurations on the severity of the attack.\\
